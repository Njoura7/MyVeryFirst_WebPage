                Paul Van Haver ( born 12 March 1985), better known by his stage name Stromae , is a Belgian singer-songwriter, rapper and musician. He is mostly known for his works in the genre of the hip hop and electronic music. Stromae came to wide public attention in 2009 with his song "Alors on danse" (from the album Cheese), which became a number one in several European countries. In 2013, his second album Racine carrée was a commercial success, selling 2 million copies in France alone and nearly 600,000 units elsewhere.[citation needed] The main singles from the album include "Papaoutai" and "Formidable". He has sold over 8.5 million records worldwide.

                Paul Van Haver was born in Brussels and raised in the city's Laeken district, to a Rwandan Tutsi father, Pierre Rutare, and a Belgian Flemish mother, Miranda Van Haver. He and his siblings were raised by their mother, as his father, a prominent architect, was killed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, while visiting his family. He attended the Sacré-coeur de Jette, a Jesuit school in Jette, the Collège Saint-Paul in Godinne, after failing in the public school system at the age of sixteen. He formed a small rap group with his friends while still in school. His early influences included Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel, Cuban son, and Congolese rumba.
